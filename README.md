# About Me
*My name is Muktha Ramesh, and I'm a sophomore majoring in 6-3.  Currently, I'm still exploring different areas of CS: for instance, this semester I'm taking 6.3900, 6.1910, and 6.1040.  Overall, I'm pretty excited about this class and learning about what makes a piece of software work, as well as getting exposure to a bunch of different software and tools we might use in real life.*

Here are 3 fun facts about me:
1. I binge watched most of the Marvel movies again over the summer.
2. My favorite food is \(currently\) Honey-Chipotle Shrimp Tacos from On The Border.
3. I designed and 3D printed a functional webslinger once.
