### Final Domains
1. School: I'm at MIT, and I want to get as much out of it as I can before I leave. I want to get good grades, and make sure that I'm actually learning instead of just learning at a surface level.  I notice that I do better with studying when I'm with friends, and I also notice that I often recheck class deadlines (which are spread out through a bunch of websites) to make sure I never miss any.  I actually make a doc at the beginning of each semester which condenses the syllabus of each class into the grading scheme, the attendance policy, the lateness policy, and when deadlines generally are just to make it easier to check and track later in the semester.
2. Travelling: It's always a hassle whenever we travel somewhere as a family (or with my friends).  First we have to plan out everything and make sure everyone is happy, try and save money where we can, and make sure we don't forget anything. Otherwise, it becomes harder to enjoy ourselves at our destination.
3. Clothes/Style: This is something I had trouble with.  I dedicated a lot of time just trying to learn how to find good clothing, and what was right for me, and I'm sure a lot of people go through this as well.  Then there's actually finding clothes that you like and look good in.
    
### Problems
1. School
    - Keeping track of deadlines
        - Right now, there's a bunch of websites that class schedules are distributed between like Canvas, catsoop, maybe another google calendar, and that makes it hard to keep track of when exams are, when homework is due, etc.  Personal calendars can also include meet-ups, internship deadlines and interviews, and more which can also make it even more difficult to keep track of what you need to do.
    - Keeping track of all relevant parts of syllibi: 
        - Whenever I'm overwhelmed with work, I want to know about lateness penalties, slack days, and how many slack days I have left as well.  I also want to know when deadlines generally are, so I don't miss any.  Nowadays, I spend a couple of hours at the beginning of the year to put all of this info from the syllibi of all my classes in one doc so I don't spend time (when I really don't have it) looking up information from all the syllibi.
    - Finding time to study with someone: 
        - We have the PSet partners website, but in my experience, usually the first meeting never happens because of scheduling. I like studying with friends, but again, finding friends with the same classes and managing their schedule with mine (especially when we have different deadlines for other classes, and maybe internship interviews and clubs) is a little difficult.  There exists time to do it, but finding that time over text/email is time-consuming.
2. Travelling
    - Planning itenerary at location: Making sure everyone has a say
        - sometimes with friends, one person is more vocal about where they want to go, and the people that mention their ideas once or twice don't get it on the itenerary and aren't as happy
    - Planning itenerary at location: Making sure it's feasible with time/budget constraints
        - we have Expedia for stays/flights, but we don't have budget estimators for local expenses like food, Uber/rental travel, prices for the locations you go to
    - Making sure you don't forget anything
        - There's a lot of things you need to bring when you're travelling on vacation, maybe back home, or maybe moving into a college dorm the first time.  It would be nice if there was an easy way to track what you already have packed, and an easy way to buy anything you don't have.
3. Clothes/Style
    - Basics of clothing
        - Style is subjective, but there are some things that help your clothes look better like color and if it's the right fit.  Many people don't know what looks best on them though, and it does take some time and some research to figure out.
    - Finding clothes you like
        - Many people have things like pintrest boards for clothing, but can't find the same things when they go to a store or look online.  It would be cool to make this process a little easier
    - Tailored clothes
        - For indian clothes, my mom likes to remeasure me everytime we need new ones since they are tailored to fit you.  I'm sure the same is true with buying a good suit.  However, this might be difficult if you don't know the correct locations to measure from and/or if you're doing it for yourself.
