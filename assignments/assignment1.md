### Final Domains
1. School: I'm at MIT, and I want to get as much out of it as I can before I leave. I want to get good grades, and make sure that I'm actually learning instead of just learning at a surface level.  I notice that I do better with studying when I'm with friends, and I also notice that I often recheck class deadlines (which are spread out through a bunch of websites) to make sure I never miss any.  I actually make a doc at the beginning of each semester which condenses the syllabus of each class into the grading scheme, the attendance policy, the lateness policy, and when deadlines generally are just to make it easier to check and track later in the semester.
2. Travelling: Whenever I travel with family or friends, planning always turns into a hassle. We have to make sure everyone is happy, balance budgets, and avoid forgetting important things. If we don’t plan carefully, the stress carries over and makes it harder to enjoy the actual trip.ourselves at our destination.
3. Clothes/Style: I’ve struggled personally with clothing and style—learning what looks good on me, how to find clothes I like, and figuring out my style took a lot of time. I know many others go through the same process. Even once you know what works for you, it’s hard to consistently find clothing that fits both your preferences and your budget.
    
### Problems
1. School
    - Keeping track of deadlines: deadline sources from personal calendars and many different websites for classes
    - Taking Notes in Lecture/Recitation: lecture moves too quickly
    - Finding a study buddy
2. Travelling
    - Making sure everyone has a say in activities at destination
    - Planning itenerary at a location (not just the plane/hotel): Making sure it's feasible with time/budget constraints
    - Making sure you don't forget anything
3. Clothes/Style
    - Using/Learning Basics of Clothing - Style is subjective, but there are some things that help your clothes look better like color and if it's the right fit. 
    - Overpaying for clothing that's cheaper online or at a different store.
    - Measuring yourself for tailored clothes (ie for suits, indian clothes, etc.)

### Selected
1. *Taking Notes in Lecture*
    - Sometimes the teacher moves too quickly and I can't take notes.  Sometimes I can take notes but my focus is writing everything down, not absorbing what's being said
    - I know that this is a serious problem, as me and my friends have talked about it. It's also a reason that sometimes students skip lecture (even though it's a good time to ask questions) because lecture isn't useful if you can't absorb the material and record what you learned.  I think I also have an interesting insight into this that could make a really cool solution that hasn't been done by any note-taking apps before.  It could be a little more difficult that other problems that I could address, but I think it would be exciting and very useful to solve for many college and high school students.
    
    - In high school, we also had this problem and the way that many friend groups at school solved it was by taking notes together on a shared doc.  This gave them a way to really think about what they were learning while getting the information down.  They could also annotate and add on to what others were adding.
    - However, this was most useful in non-technical classes (ie not math or science) because in those cases, it's better to write 
    - solution saves time and the notes are more comprehensive + you have more time to really absorb what the lecturer is saying
        - you also choose who you write notes with so it's usefule at a smaller scale and you only do it with people you trust to also do the work
2. *Group Planning for Travelling*
    - This is an issue for both travelling with friends and with family.  Sometimes making specific plans at the place gets delayed/forgotten until the last possible moment, or perhaps more vocal people get their plans in while other people don't.  Sometimes the organizer gets the most say in events, which the rest of the people don't like. Both of these problems have happened with both family and friend trips for me, and it causes unhappiness and sometimes wasted money.  I think that this is a good problem to solve because it makes sure everyone is happy with the trip, or at least has a say.  It might save time as well, and you might be able to book earlier if people don't keep forgetting to figure out what they're doing.  I think that this is a widespread problem and it can be serious because you're spending a lot of money and want to make sure everyone is happy.
3. *Right Price*
    - checks online for it, then checks for similar clothes, and potentially coupons and such as well
    - There's a lot of friction with this problem.  If you have some clothes, you have to try searching it up on the website of the store that you're at, and oftentimes you don't check other stores because of how long it takes.  However, you can save a lot of money if you actually did check other stores for similar products.  Thus, I think that this is a serious, widespread problem to solve.

### Not Selected
1. *Keeping track of deadlines*
    - I think if this problem mattered to a person, they might have already figured out a solution via planners, iCal links, and more.  I don't think that a solution that I could come up with (ie integrating all the calendars together) would be that much better that just using iCal links.  If people don't use these other solutions, they just might not find this problem as that serious too.
2. *Finding time to study with someone*
    - A lot of people just text in the group chat, or have a space to do homework already.  I don't think that this problem is very widespread.  Additionally, this gains value with more users so it might not be as valuable at the beginning.  I'm also solving a varient of this problem as a side-project, so it wouldn't be as enjoyable for me to do as a project.
3. *Planning itenerary at location: Making sure it's feasible with time/budget constraints*
    - I don't think this problem is as serious or as widespread.  I think that if you're going on vacation or travelling and already have a list of places to go, it's pretty easy to gauge whether an attraction there is too expensive for the budget. I think checking if you have time for it is pretty easy without an app too, and an app might add more friction rather than reduce it.
4. *Travel packing lists*
    - I don't think that this is as serious of a problem.  Lot's of people just use sheets or docs, and there's easy sharing and checking off. 
5. *Basics of clothing*
    - I think that I'm still learning, and I wouldn't make the best possible software to help address this problem.  Additionally, the only solution I can think of that hasn't been done to help speed this up is to use a camera to figure out what might look good for a person, and I don't know if I have the skill set for that yet.
6. *Tailored clothes*
    - I decided not to go for this one because I don't think there are many ways to speed the process up and make it easier. The only thing I could come up with is having an app do it for you with a camera.  However, with my current knowledge, I don't think this is a feasible project for me to do in a month or two.  Additionally, at that point it might be easier for the user to look up a tutorial on how to use a measuring tape to do it.
