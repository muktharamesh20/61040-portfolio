# Assignment 1

## Domains
### Brainstorming Domains
1. School: Studying together, keeping together deadlines, planning classes together
2. Sports: Finding local areas to play, Practicing with friends, finding right equipment
3. Time mangagement: Dealing with school, clubs, social events, internships, and sleep.
4. Music: learning, playing, and making music
5. Internships: Keeping track of deadlines, what you've applied to, prepearing for OA's/Interviews
6. Travelling: Finding places to go, planning with other people
7. Clothing/Style: Finding the right clothes for you
8. Friendships: figuring out what activities to do, when everyone is free
9. 3d printing: Finding/creating models, using a 3D printer
10. Safety: All types of safety when you go out
 
### Final Domains
1. School: I'm at MIT, and I want to get as much out of it as I can before I leave. I want to get good grades, and make sure that I'm actually learning instead of just learning at a surface level.  I notice that I do better with studying when I'm with friends, and I also notice that I often recheck class deadlines (which are spread out through a bunch of websites) to make sure I never miss any.  I actually make a doc at the beginning of each semester which condenses the syllabus of each class into the grading scheme, the attendance policy, the lateness policy, and when deadlines generally are just to make it easier to check and track later in the semester.
2. Travelling: Whenever I travel with family or friends, planning always turns into a hassle. We have to make sure everyone is happy, balance budgets, and avoid forgetting important things. If we don’t plan carefully, the stress carries over and makes it harder to enjoy the actual trip.ourselves at our destination.
3. Clothes/Style: I’ve struggled personally with clothing and style—learning what looks good on me, how to find clothes I like, and figuring out my style took a lot of time. I know many others go through the same process. Even once you know what works for you, it’s hard to consistently find clothing that fits both your preferences and your budget.
    
### Problems
1. School
    - Keeping track of deadlines: deadline sources from personal calendars and many different websites for classes
    - Taking Notes in Lecture/Recitation: lecture moves too quickly
    - Finding a study buddy
2. Travelling
    - Group planning for Travelling: Making sure everyone has a say in activities at destination
    - Planning itenerary at a location (not just the plane/hotel): Making sure it's feasible with time/budget constraints
    - Making sure you don't forget anything
3. Clothes/Style
    - Using/Learning Basics of Clothing - Style is subjective, but there are some things that help your clothes look better like color and if it's the right fit. 
    - Overpaying for clothing that's cheaper online or at a different store or with coupons.
    - Measuring yourself for tailored clothes (ie for suits, indian clothes, etc.)

### Selected
1. *Taking Better Notes in Lecture*
    - Sometimes the teacher moves too quickly and I can't take notes.  Sometimes I can take notes but my focus is writing everything down, not absorbing what's being said.  Handwriting notes is better for retention, but typing is faster as well
    - I know that this is a serious problem, as me and my friends have talked about it. It's also a reason that sometimes students skip lecture (even though it's a good time to ask questions) because lecture isn't useful if you can't absorb the material and record what you learned.  I think I also have an interesting insight into this that could make a really cool solution that hasn't been done by any note-taking apps before.  It could be a little more difficult that other problems that I could address, but I think it would be exciting and very useful to solve for many college and high school students.
    
2. *Group Planning for Travelling*
    - This is an issue for both travelling with friends and with family.  Sometimes making specific plans at the place gets delayed/forgotten until the last possible moment, or perhaps more vocal people get their plans in while other people don't.  Sometimes the organizer gets the most say in events, which the rest of the people don't like. Both of these problems have happened with both family and friend trips for me, and it causes unhappiness and sometimes wasted money.  I think that this is a good problem to solve because it makes sure everyone is happy with the trip, or at least has a say.  It might save time as well, and you might be able to book earlier if people don't keep forgetting to figure out what they're doing.  I think that this is a widespread problem and it can be serious because you're spending a lot of money and want to make sure everyone is happy.

3. *Right Price*
    - There's a lot of friction with this problem.  If you're in person and want to buy some clothes, some clothes, in order to save money, you have to try searching it up on the website of the store that you're at which can take a while.  You also might miss the same clothing from different stores that are cheaper, or coupons.  I think this is a serious problem and a solution could reduce friction, save money, and be useful.  It's also feasible and could have a good software solution

### Not Selected
1. *Keeping track of deadlines*
    - I think if this problem mattered to a person, they might have already figured out a solution via planners, iCal links, and more.  I don't think that a solution that I could come up with (ie integrating all the calendars together) would be that much better that just using iCal links.  If people don't use these other solutions, they just might not find this problem as that serious too.
2. *Finding time to study with someone*
    - A lot of people just text in the group chat, or have a space to do homework already.  I don't think that this problem is very widespread.  Additionally, this gains value with more users so it might not be as valuable at the beginning.  I'm also solving a varient of this problem as a side-project, so it wouldn't be as enjoyable for me to do as a project.
3. *Planning itenerary at location: Making sure it's feasible with time/budget constraints*
    - I don't think this problem is as serious or as widespread.  I think that if you're going on vacation or travelling and already have a list of places to go, it's pretty easy to gauge whether an attraction there is too expensive for the budget. It's also not as useful as checking flight prices because you can save money with flight prices, not as much with a specific attraction (ie a museum) that you want to visit.  The problem isn't that serious, and an app might add more friction rather than reduce it.
4. *Travel packing lists*
    - I don't think that this is as serious of a problem.  Lot's of people just use sheets or docs, and there's easy sharing and checking off. 
5. *Basics of clothing*
    - I think that I'm still learning, and I wouldn't make the best possible software to help address this problem.  Additionally, the only solution I can think of that hasn't been done to help speed this up is to use a camera to figure out what might look good for a person, and I don't know if I have the skill set for that yet.
6. *Tailored clothes*
    - I decided not to go for this one because I don't think there are many ways to speed the process up and make it easier. The only thing I could come up with is having an app do it for you with a camera.  However, with my current knowledge, I don't think this is a feasible project for me to do in a month or two.  Additionally, at that point it might be easier for the user to look up a tutorial on how to use a measuring tape to do it.


## Evidence
1. *Taking Better Notes in Lecture*
    1.  Research indicates that students fail to record
40% of the important points in a typical lecture (Hartley &
Cameron, 1967; Howe, 1970), with first-year students
recording, on average, only 11% (Locke, 1977). Material
written on the blackboard makes it into students' notes at a
higher rate than material communicated verbally: students
record most of the blackboard information (Locke, 1977),
but only about 10% of information delivered orally
(Johnstone & Su, 1994).

    2. Researcn Research ihdicates indicates that tnat a
a moderate moderate speed speed of
delivery, around 135 words per minute, best supports student notetaking (Peters, 1972). Faculty can evaluate their
pace by asking a colleague to sit in on a lecture or by distributing a short survey to students, including items such
“The pace of today’s lecture was a) Too slow, b) About pace of today s lecture was a) 100 si right, c) Too fast."


Handouts
Faculty can support student notetaking by distributing
handouts for students to use while taking notes or while
reviewing their lecture notes. Students take better notes and
review material more effectively if faculty provide a “scaffold," such as an outline, an overview, or other advance
organizer for students to use while taking notes. The
research on notetaking focuses on three kinds of handouts:
outlines, graphic organizers, and copies (full or partial) 
    
    1. esearchers reported that successful students recorded more notes and recalled more information than less successful college students; however, these successful college students only recorded between 25 and 33% of the total ideas presented in the lecture. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608014001198?utm_source=chatgpt.com

    2. Handwritten notes improve retention by 10–20 %, conceptual understanding by ~25 %, exam scores by up to 15 %

    1. Taking verbatim notes (passive transcription) is widespread but ineffective

Many students merely “record everything,” which limits meaningful processing

- AI-assisted note-taking

AI tools improve speed but can reduce cognitive engagement; moderate assistance outperforms high automation

- Collaborative peer note-taking for students with disabilities (EmoBridge)

Real-time sharing with emojis improves participation but limited to SWD contexts and small sample sizes

2. *Group Planning for Travelling*

- According to a study by gocity.com, the biggest pain points for travellers are 44% overspending, 26% packing, 23% planning, 21% missing a scheduled flight, train, and/or bus, 17% ensuring everyone's wants and needs are satisfied by the itenerary

- Lack of personalization leads to dissatisfaction

Study: Research published in the International Journal of Innovative Research and Technology found that personalization significantly impacts customer satisfaction in the travel industry.

- shows how more vocal people, strong opinion clearly influences decision over the people who are more agreeable
" In other
words, the weight of Mr. A’s opinion was larger than other members. At the same time, we can speculate
that had other members had similarly strong opinions, the resulting outcome might have been different.
Such information cannot be observed from the outcome alone, but we were able to capture it with the
proposed x-GDP method"

-Recent research suggests that tourists do not always plan their trips in great detail or even
if they do, they often change their plans (March & Woodside, 2005). It is of great importance to
scholars and practitioners in tourism to better understand what drives trip planning and
unplanned travel behavior and what roles situational and personal factors play. s (March & Woodside, 2005) https://scholarworks.umass.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/a0421bd8-048e-4b96-89e9-e87e4e10f7e4/content

-A recent study reported that an artificial intelligence agent can help travelers save approximately 90% of their time searching for information (Shi et al., 2021).

-Most recommender systems mainly target individuals or groups without considering the diversity of preferences within a travel group (Mohammad Arif et al., 2015)

-Group Communication: The leader has to usually keep messaging people to make sure they know the plan ahead of time
Preparation vs Spontaneity: Have to be ready for things to change depending on how the group feels

3. *Right Price*
- Over half (53%) of shoppers say that they have been buying more secondhand clothes as a way of saving money in 2022, as the cost of living rises
- Depop’s research reveals you could save up to 25% per item when shopping secondhand - an average of £185 in a year across all purchases

- 
18-35 year olds are making an average of £350 a year by selling unused clothing lurking in their wardrobes

- The average lifespan of a garment is just 19 wears but on average, UK Depop users estimate that they wear an item a total of 49 times, offering more value for money

## Features
1. *Taking Notes in Lecture*
    - shared notes with friends:
        - saves time and the notes are more comprehensive + you have more time to really absorb what the lecturer is saying
        - you also choose who you write notes with so it's usefule at a smaller scale and you only do it with people you trust to also do the work

    - audio synced with notes... you can visually see what you were writing as you go backwards, so you don't have to revisit the entire lecture notes and can re-listen to the confusing parts or parts where you don't have as much notes in
2. *Group Planning for Travelling*
    - 
    - something that weighs each person's idea (potentially by cost) but also by who was happy last time (ur ideas are weighed a little more heavily if you weren't happy last time)
3. *Right Price*
    - checks online for it, then checks for similar clothes
    - standalone site that compiles a bunch of clothes, has price and sustainibility and brand
    -
