8. Friendships: figuring out what activities to do, when everyone is free
9. 3d printing: Finding/creating models, using a 3D printer
10. Safety: All types of safety when you go out
 
### Final Domains
1. School: I'm at MIT, and I want to get as much out of it as I can before I leave. I want to get good grades, and make sure that I'm actually learning instead of just learning at a surface level.  I notice that I do better with studying when I'm with friends, and I also notice that I often recheck class deadlines (which are spread out through a bunch of websites) to make sure I never miss any.  I actually make a doc at the beginning of each semester which condenses the syllabus of each class into the grading scheme, the attendance policy, the lateness policy, and when deadlines generally are just to make it easier to check and track later in the semester.
2. Travelling: Whenever I travel with family or friends, planning always turns into a hassle. We have to make sure everyone is happy, balance budgets, and avoid forgetting important things. If we don’t plan carefully, the stress carries over and makes it harder to enjoy the actual trip.ourselves at our destination.
3. Clothes/Style: I’ve struggled personally with clothing and style—learning what looks good on me, how to find clothes I like, and figuring out my style took a lot of time. I know many others go through the same process. Even once you know what works for you, it’s hard to consistently find clothing that fits both your preferences and your budget.
    
### Problems
1. School
    - Keeping track of deadlines: deadline sources from personal calendars and many different websites for classes
    - Taking Notes in Lecture/Recitation: lecture moves too quickly
    - Finding a study buddy
2. Travelling
    - Group planning for Travelling: Making sure everyone has a say in activities at destination
    - Planning itenerary at a location (not just the plane/hotel): Making sure it's feasible with time/budget constraints
    - Making sure you don't forget anything
3. Clothes/Style
    - Using/Learning Basics of Clothing - Style is subjective, but there are some things that help your clothes look better like color and if it's the right fit. 
    - Overpaying for clothing that's cheaper online or at a different store or with coupons.
    - Measuring yourself for tailored clothes (ie for suits, indian clothes, etc.)

### Selected
1. *Taking Better Notes in Lecture*
    - Sometimes the teacher moves too quickly and I can't take notes.  Sometimes I can take notes but my focus is writing everything down, not absorbing what's being said.  Additionally, some students face the dilemna between handwriting notes which is better for retention, and typing which is faster.
    - I know that this is a serious problem, as me and my friends have talked about it. It's also a reason that sometimes students skip lecture (even though it's a good time to ask questions) because lecture isn't useful if you can't absorb the material and record what you learned.  I think I also have an interesting insight into this that could make a really cool solution.  It could be a little more difficult that other problems that I could address, but I think it would be exciting and very useful to solve for many college and high school students.
     - Stakeholders: User (Student/Note-taker), Teachers (The person whose class the user is taking notes in), Parents (The parents of the user)
        - Student: The student is directly affected.  Poorer notes lead to more stress, more time to review for tests, and less comprehension and retention.  This could also lead to lower test scores, and some students even skipping lecture because they don't think it's useful.
        - Teacher/Lecturer: Students might appear disengaged if they're struggling to take notes.  They also might appear in office hours more often, and need more help.
        - Parents/Guardians: They might worry about academic performance and study habits of their student, and might feel stressed as well.  A solution that helps their kid study would make them feel better.
    
2. *Group Planning is a hassle for Travelling*
    - This is an issue for both travelling with friends and with family.  Sometimes making specific plans at the place gets delayed/forgotten until the last possible moment, or perhaps more vocal people get their plans in while other people don't.  Sometimes the organizer gets the most say in events, which the rest of the people don't like. Both of these problems have happened with both family and friend trips for me, and it causes unhappiness and sometimes wasted money.  I think that this is a good problem to solve because it makes sure everyone is happy with the trip, or at least has a say.  It might save time as well, and you might be able to book earlier if people don't keep forgetting to figure out what they're doing.  I think that this is a widespread problem and it can be serious because you're spending a lot of money and want to make sure everyone is happy.
    - Stakeholders:
        - Trip Organizer:  Usually there is one person taking the lead in organizing the trip.  They might have to repetitively send out texts to get events to work together.  They could feel stressed, overwhelmed, or frusterated if the group preferences are unclear or conflicting
        - Travel companionas (the people who are part of the trip, but aren't the "main" person orgainzing it): Might feel ignored, unhappy, or stressed if their ideas aren't being reflected in the itenerary
        - Attractions:  Delayed or last minute bookings can cause inefficiencies or lost revenue.  Additionally, if people decide not to go to a certain event due to the best attractions not being chosen, then some attractions might also lose revenue that way.

3. *Right Price For clothing*
    - There's a lot of friction with this problem.  If you're in person and want to buy some clothes, some clothes, in order to save money, you have to try searching it up on the website of the store that you're at which can take a while.  You also might miss the same clothing from different stores that are cheaper, or coupons. Or potentially clothes that are more eco-friendly, have better material, or more. I think this is a serious problem and a solution could reduce friction, save money, and be useful.  It's also feasible and could have a good software solution
    - Stakeholders: 
        - Shopper: Directly affected; currently experiences friction, wasted time, and missed savings. A solution could save money and reduce effort in price comparisons.
        - Retailers/Stores: Indirectly affected; price comparisons may lead to lost sales if they are not competitive, but could also motivate better pricing and promotions.
        - Fashion Brands: Indirectly affected; reputation and sales could be influenced by how their products are ranked or compared. A solution highlighting brand attributes like sustainability or quality could impact perception.

### Not Selected
1. *Keeping track of deadlines*
    - I think if this problem mattered to a person, they might have already figured out a solution via planners, iCal links, and more.  I don't think that a solution that I could come up with (ie integrating all the calendars together) would be that much better that just using iCal links.  If people don't use these other solutions, they just might not find this problem as that serious too.
2. *Finding time to study with someone*
    - A lot of people just text in the group chat, or have a space to do homework already.  I don't think that this problem is very widespread.  Additionally, this gains value with more users so it might not be as valuable at the beginning.  I'm also solving a varient of this problem as a side-project, so it wouldn't be as enjoyable for me to do as a project.
3. *Planning itenerary at location: Making sure it's feasible with time/budget constraints*
    - I don't think this problem is as serious or as widespread.  I think that if you're going on vacation or travelling and already have a list of places to go, it's pretty easy to gauge whether an attraction there is too expensive for the budget. It's also not as useful as checking flight prices because you can save money with flight prices, not as much with a specific attraction (ie a museum) that you want to visit.  The problem isn't that serious, and an app might add more friction rather than reduce it.
4. *Travel packing lists*
    - I don't think that this is as serious of a problem.  Lot's of people just use sheets or docs, and there's easy sharing and checking off. 
5. *Basics of clothing*
    - I think that I'm still learning, and I wouldn't make the best possible software to help address this problem.  Additionally, the only solution I can think of that hasn't been done to help speed this up is to use a camera to figure out what might look good for a person, and I don't know if I have the skill set for that yet.
6. *Tailored clothes*
    - I decided not to go for this one because I don't think there are many ways to speed the process up and make it easier. The only thing I could come up with is having an app do it for you with a camera.  However, with my current knowledge, I don't think this is a feasible project for me to do in a month or two.  Additionally, at that point it might be easier for the user to look up a tutorial on how to use a measuring tape to do it.


## Evidence
1. *Taking Better Notes in Lecture* 
    1. [You're only recording 60% of the important points in a lecture on average.](https://crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/CRLT_no16.pdf) Research indicates that students fail to record 40% of the important points in a typical lecture.
    2. [First-year students record less, only 11% of the important points in a lecture](https://crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/CRLT_no16.pdf)First-year students record, on average, only 11% of the important points in a typical lecture(Locke, 1977). 
    3. [Only 10% of oral information is recorded, as more focus is put on slides/blackboards.](https://crlt.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource_files/CRLT_no16.pdf) Students record most of the blackboard information, but only about 10% of information delivered orally.
    4. [Some listeners perform better when the material was presented at a normal rate, or when note-taking was not required suggesting students need time to process and absorb the material.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1972-27861-001) Research indicates indicates that that a moderate moderate speed speed of delivery, around 135 words per minute, best supports student notetaking.
    5. [There's a correlation between recording better notes (with more information and better structure) and performing better in class](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608014001198?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Researchers reported that successful students recorded more notes than less successful college students.  Though these notes only comprised of 25%-33% of the ideas of the lecture, these notes also had better organization and structure of the lecture than less successful students had.
    6. [Note-taking tools improve speed but have the potential to increase or reduce cognitive engagement.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03392) A study found out of three levels of AI engagement (high assistance with structured notes, moderate asistance with real-time summary, and low assitance with transcript), the moderate use of AI resulted in the highest post-test scores, with the high use of AI resulting in the lowest. Interestingly, people preferred the high assitance due to the ease of use and effort even though they scored the lowest.
    7. [Collaborative peer note-takers perform better than individual note takers on recall tasks, but not writing tasks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109675162200029X) A study on collaborative note taking suggests "that access to high-quality notes are a driver of learning performance on quizzes, which explains the superior results of collaborative note-takers in this regard, whereas the process of recording notes may drive a learner's ability to apply these concepts in the form of academic writing, which explains the superior results of the individual note-takers in this regard"
    8. [Comparable 1: MaRginalia](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706598.3714065) MaRginalia is a note-taking system which automatically takes screenshots of lecture slids and creates a transcript from the lecturer's words. The user can then take notes on these slides screenshots and the transcript.  According to users, it was beneficial to catch up on missed information, helpful not to rewrite what the lecturer was saying, and to stay focussed on the slides and professor, while others said it was overcomplex.  One additional con is that it requires specialized equipment as it's a tablet and a VR headset.
    9. [Comparable 2: Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) Google docs is a free platform to take notes.  Many students like typing there because it is faster and allows for real-time collaboration.  However, there isn't support for hand-written notes and according to research, hand-written notes is better for retention than typed notes are.
    10. [Comparable 3: GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) GoodNotes is known primarily for its handwriting experience.  You can write notes by hand and search it up later as well.  It's also useful to sync across platforms.  However, it's known to be very buggy and expensive.


2. *Group Planning for Travelling*
    1. [Planning for a trip is a major pain point. 23% of people from a survey consider it as one of the biggest pain points, and 17% of people say that ensuring everyone's wants and needs are satisfied by the itenerary is one of the biggest pain points](https://gocity.com/en/blog/trip-planning-consumer-habits-usa?utm_source=chatgpt.com) According to a study by gocity.com which included individual and group travelers, the biggest pain points for travellers include: overspending (44%), packing (26%), planning (23%), missing a scheduled flight , train, and/or bus (21%), and ensuring everyone's wants and needs are satisfied by the itenerary (17%).
    2. [Lack of personalization leads to dissatisfaction](https://ijirt.org/publishedpaper/IJIRT183293_PAPER.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) According to research published in the International Journal of Innovative Research and Technology, personalization of the travel itenerary significantly impacts customer satisfaction in the travel industry. 
    3. [A stronger voice in group travel planning can significantly impact the final destination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13463) Case studies show how a strong opinion clearly influences decision over the people who are more agreeable.
    4. [Group reccommendation systems are increasingly important for collective decisions.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407000863) This research considers a variety of algorithms to create a group reccomendation system, which is considered more in demand as community activities online (like purchasing something) is growing exponentially.
    5. [Travel organizers feel as though they need to keep reminding people to work on the plan](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/simplifying-the-trip-planning-experience-for-group-trip-leaders-a-product-design-case-study-ffc3e10eb547) A case study suggests the leader has to usually keep messaging people to make sure they know the plan ahead of time
    6. [Plans change due to spontaneity of the group, but current tools don't account for this.](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/simplifying-the-trip-planning-experience-for-group-trip-leaders-a-product-design-case-study-ffc3e10eb547) User research and interviews conducted by a Medium writer shows that spontenaiety is something that trip planners consider when devising travel plans, but is not addressed by many tools today.  Flexibility is valued by people.
    7. [70% of Americans who plan vacations find bookinng travel to be stressful](https://business.yougov.com/content/51330-us-travel-stress-report-2025) According to a survey by YouGov, 70% of people who plan vacations find booking to be stress-inducing.
    8. [Parents feel more stressed when making travel plans](https://civicscience.com/as-vacation-season-heats-up-many-americans-are-feeling-stressed-over-travel-planning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  According to CivicScience, 78% of parents with kids under 18 feel stressed when planning for a vacation.
    9. [Comparable 1: Tripit](https://www.tripit.com/web?pid=ppc&cid=us_goo_C_Search_Brand_ex_tripit&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=217781080&gbraid=0AAAAAD7Cqdzgig1uNFtfYw7WZGVO4Sx0K&gclid=CjwKCAjw2vTFBhAuEiwAFaScwrMuHLjMiLXTjFdbNOxpaU5I9oelBd8uh9FXG_5S1_moqX7FoNE84xoCID4QAvD_BwE)  Tripit makes planning less stressful by giving you reminders about where you should be, if anything changed with your flight or other plans, and helps coordinate groups.  It allows you to share your trips with other travelers.  However, there isn't an easy way to collaborate within the app and share preferences between members.
    10. [Comparable 2: Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/) Wanderlog is good for collaborative planning, but it can be overwhelming with features such as booking, managing budgets, searching up reviews and locations, expense tracking, and more.  It also doesn't have a fairness mechanism based on what each group member wants to visit. 

3. *Right Price*
    1. [Shoppers want to save money when buying clothes](https://news.depop.com/company-news/depop-reveals-how-much-you-can-save-by-shopping-secondhand/)  According to resarch by Depop, over half (53%) of shoppers say that they have been buying more secondhand clothes as a way of saving money in 2022
    2. [Many consumers are already looking for cheaper items online when going shopping.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265117947_Influence_of_consumers%27_online_decision-making_style_on_comparison_shopping_proneness_and_perceived_usefulness_of_comparison_shopping_tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  According to a reasearch study, "consumers looking for good value for money are prone to shop across Web sites to find suitable alternatives"
    3. [Fast fashion has been on the rise for the last two years.](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/blog/cheap-clothes-high-costs-individual-choices-cant-thread-the-needle-on-fast-fashion/)  In fact, according to Roosevelt Instiute, Shein, which is a site that sells items for very cheap, accounted for 40% of fast fashion spending and became the most downloaded app on the app store.
    4. [People like to get more value for their money when it comes to clothes](https://news.depop.com/company-news/depop-reveals-how-much-you-can-save-by-shopping-secondhand/) The average lifespan of a garment is just 19 wears but on average, UK Depop users estimate that they wear an item a total of 49 times, offering more value for money.
    5. [Price variability online between stores and in-person is real.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022435918300046?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Research shows substantial online price dispersion across retailers (and often higher online than offline), implying comparison can save money.
    6. [39% of people had regrets of feeling like they purchased clothing that was less valuable than they expected](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/buyers-remorse-due-to-online-shopping-has-affected-seventy-four-percent-of-americans-according-to-survey-commissioned-by-slickdeals-301511257.html#:~:text=Share%20this%20article,/exchanging%20them%20(39%25).) Out of 2000 Americans, a poll by Slickdeals found that 39% had regrets about having purchased an item that was less valuable than expected.
    7.  [32% of people felt that they spend too much money on clothing in the first place](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/buyers-remorse-due-to-online-shopping-has-affected-seventy-four-percent-of-americans-according-to-survey-commissioned-by-slickdeals-301511257.html#:~:text=Share%20this%20article,/exchanging%20them%20(39%25).)

    8. [Comparable 1:Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/coupons/categories/department-stores?srsltid=AfmBOoqLXyt54m0W_f3D3uKfNfaA5yXM2heQZdB9OPxvaWC0EDvxxNU_) Groupon helps wit finding coupons, but not with finding clothing-specific searches.
    9. [Comparable 2: Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/explore) Honey helps with finding coupons, but not with finding clothing-specific searches
    10. [Comparable 3: Pintrist](https://www.pinterest.com/) Lets you reverse-image search products and gives you products you can buy that are similar, but has no filtering or sorting option and it's not very well known since pintrist has a different main feature.  It also doesn't have coupons.

## Features and Stakeholders
1. *Taking Notes in Lecture*
    - Students can collaborate in real time with handwritten notes during lectures. Multiple people contribute to the same digital notebook simultaneously, each adding diagrams, annotations, or summaries.  Here are some stakeholders:
        1. User (Student/Note-taker)
            - Impacts: the users of the app save time while taking notes, get more comprehensive notes, and have more time in class to really absorb the material.  Because it's handwritten, they can collaborate on technical classes as well, which a platform like Google Docs doesn't help them with.  This could help them get better academic performance 
            - Potentially negative impacts: Suffers if collaborating with someone who doesn’t contribute.
        2. Teacher
            - Some high school and potentially college teachers don't like students collaborating on their notes as those notes might be used for assessments, or the teachers might simply be worried about accountability.  However, other teachers might also prefer and encourage it because it can lead to increased engagement and performance from students.
        3. Parents and Guardians
            - Parents want their students to do well in school, and thus they would likely like this feature provided that it actually helps students.
            - Potentially negative impact: They may worry about over-reliance on peers when note-taking
    - Notes are synced with lecture audio, so students can play back the lecture and see exactly what they were writing at that moment. This allows selective review of confusing sections without replaying the entire lecture.  Here are some stakeholders:
        1. User (Student/Note-taker)
            - Positive: Easy to focus on confusing sections without replaying the whole lecture; students can focus on what's currently happening rather than falling behind on note-taking stress-free.
            - Negative: Possible dependency on the audio feature instead of engaging actively during lecture.
        2. Teacher/Lecturer
            - Some teachers/lecturers don't want to be recorded
            - Students might not be as engaged if they plan on going back
            - Some teachers might like it if students retain information better
        3. Friends/Non-Users
            - If a friend is stuck or missed something from lecture, they can also get help from you because you can pinpoint exactly where you were when writing the place they got stuck on.
    - Automated tagging of the notes and summarizing/breaking up the notes into relevant categories.  This helps save time when reviewing, and will help you identify where you got confused a little easier.
        1. User (Student/Note-taker) - saves time when reviewing, helps identify key concepts and their connections quickly
        2. Teacher - It might help students identify the key points easier, so the teacher would likely be happy because it helps the student study
        3. Tutors - Tutors often need to know what each student covered in lecture, but this is hard if the student doesn't understand themselves.  Smart summarization can help them quickly look at their notes and know what to do.  The user can also quickly pinpoint areas of confusion with the summarization and note tagging.

2. *Group Planning for Travelling*
    - A tool that allows people to input and rank each other's idea based on how much they want to do it.  For instance, if last time a friend group went out, they went to Alice's favorite attraction and Bob didn't like it, Bob's preferences could be weighted more heavily for the second activity on the itenerary. Here are some stakeholders:
        1. User (Trip Planner/Participant) – Ensures their interests are considered; may feel left out if rankings aren’t balanced.
        2. Friends/Travel Companions – Benefit from fair representation of their preferences; might argue over rankings.
        3. Tourism Service Providers – Indirectly affected as their offerings are chosen more frequently if popular.
    - A tool that helps budget and split costs when travelling


3. *Right Price*
    - checks online for it, then checks for similar clothes
    - standalone site that compiles a bunch of clothes, has price and sustainibility and brand and reviews.  Stakeholders May
        -   User (Shopper) – Saves time finding alternatives; may experience decision fatigue.
