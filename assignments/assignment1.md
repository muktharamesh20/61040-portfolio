Domains. From your social connections, activities, life experience, hobbies, interests, etc, identify ten domains (general problem areas) that you are interested in and might make promising subjects for a project. Then select the three that seem most promising and explain them.
A list of ten domains (with a short phrase for each)
For three of these, additionally, a few sentences explaining your interest in it
Problems. For each of your three selected domains, identify three problems that might be worth solving. Now, from all these problems (nine in total), select three that seem to you most worth pursuing, and explain them. Justify your decision to include these and to exclude each of the others. Suitable justifications might be: that you believe the problem is more or less serious or widespread; that you have a particular insight about it; that a solution would likely be very hard, or might require significant non-software elements; that it would make a more enjoyable project for some reason; etc.
A list of three problems in each of three domains with a short phrase for each
For three selected problems, a title and a few sentences explaining it, and why you included it
For the unselected problems, a sentence or two explaining why you excluded them
Stakeholders. For each of your three selected problems, identify at least three stakeholders (both direct users and non-users) who might need to be considered in judging the effectiveness of solutions to these problems, and comment on the impact the problem might have on them.
Three stakeholders for three problems, each with a name and a phrase defining them; and then for each problem, a few sentences saying which stakeholders might be affected and how.
Evidence. For each of your three selected problems, compile some evidence for or against it (how much it matters, how many users might be affected, etc), and a list of comparables (related or prior attempts at solving the problem) and their limitations. Each piece of evidence or comparable should have an associated citation link. Suitable sources include Wikipedia articles, newspaper articles, blog posts, Q&A forums. Quantitative measures are especially helpful but are not required. LLM output per se does not constitute evidence.
For each of three problems, about 10 links to evidence or comparables with a sentence or two explaining each
Features. For each of your three selected problems, suggest three features of a possible solution, explaining what it does, and why it would contribute to addressing the problem (referring when appropriate to the stakeholders you defined). These features do not have to be consistent with each other (in fitting together in an application); they are just starting points for solutions.
Nine features, each with a title and a few sentences explaining it
